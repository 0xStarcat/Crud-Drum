# **Crud Drum - online music sequencer**

**Description**
This is an online music sequencer where users can create drum loops and combine those loops into a song. It expands the drum machine created by Mary Rose Cook (link below) into a fully functional CRUD app. Drum samples are uploaded from the Rails server on page load. Synthesizer patches are provided and constructed from the Web Audio API. 

Users can save loops and songs to their profile! 
Login handled with Spotify and Twitter OAuth.
